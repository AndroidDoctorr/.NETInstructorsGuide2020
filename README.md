# Introduction

## Welcome to the Dot Net Curriculum Guide!

### This GitBook is designed to be a simple easy guide to teaching the full Eleven Fifty Academy course for Dot Net. We have broken this out as follows: 
```text
Badge 
    Week
        Day of Week
        Bonus Challenges
```
### *Each Badge has a section for its subsequent weeks and days. There may be fluctuation in each cohort's needs but this should serve as a rough guide to follow.*

# Basic Daily Outline

## **9:00 AM Start**
### 1. Take time to lay out the structure for the day
### 2. Answer any questions from the students. You should not take more than 15 minutes fot this.
### 3. Start out the day with a  morning challenge, quiz, or both
### 4. If there is no morning challenge, have a small lecture for the morning
## **Lunch**
### 5. Answer questions from the morning challenge or finish up morning lecture.
### 6. New topic for the afternoon
## **3:00 - 3:30 PM**
### 7. Stop new material by **3:00-3:30**. This is to allow time for students to catch up one-on-one or have work time for projects. If a student is advanced, look to the Bonus Challenges for that week to give them something to work on.
## **5:00 PM End Of Day**
### 8. Try your best to leave by 5:00 or 5:30 at the latest. Its good to have boundaries and we all need some rest
