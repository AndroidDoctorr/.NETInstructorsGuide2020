Welcome to day 1 of Gold Badge! We have a lot of information to cover today. Once we get all of this out of the way we can start the fun stuff.

### Staff Introductions
Take some time to introduce the Instructors and any assistants (Learning Assistants and/or Trainees) as well as any other staff that is present for introductions.

Give some background about yourself, why you do what you do, make yourself relatable, etc.

### Class Member Introductions
* What's your name?
* What did you do before coming to Eleven Fifty?
* What's your favorite ____? (ex: What's your favorite form of potato?)

### General Expectations

* Professionalism. This course focuses on both learning to code but also how to act in a code related work place.
* Minimum 90% attendance. The program moves very quickly and any time you miss will be a lost opportunity. Should a situation arise where you are required to miss class make sure you check in with your instructor(s).
* Determination/grit. This is a difficult task. There will be times where you will have to absolutely just power through the struggles.
* Effort. What you put into the program is what you will get out!
* Have a positive mental attitude. This is not easy, but if you're not able to stay positive this difficult task will be even harder.
* Ask Questions. It will help you 
* Autodidactic/Self Study.
* Help Others! You guys are a team. Work together, learn together.
* Spelling, it counts!
* Keep an eye on your syntax, it's easy to mess up.

We recommend that during code alongs you get used to taking digital notes instead of paper notes. If you can't keep up with the speed at which we are going, make sure you ask questions. You'll only improve your typing speed by typing, same way that your coding abilities will only improve the more you code.

### Intro to class
You **need** to have Windows. This **NEEDS** to be done before day 2 if somehow it was missed at this point. Markdown really limits how much I can emphasize how much the students **NEED** to have Windows.

Send out Canvas invites for the Gold Badge Course to the students.  
Installs can be checked early in the morning, or during the first challenge.  

Installs to be checked:  
* Slack
* git
* VS Code
* VS Community


### Ground Rules
Establish when you will be available on Slack. This time may change, or you may be strict on what times.  
Some instructors have opted to provide an hour each night, some instructors stay over a little, some just work in the defined hours. You will need to find what is best for you and your class. In Gold badge you will likely find students who need a little more help.

Outline the instructor/student responsibility for learning and how that will change from badge to badge. Be sure to revisit this concept at the beginning of Blue.

Remind them that this will be a fast paced course. There will still be considerable responsibility on them to make sure they're on pace. Use this time to lay out a basic outline of what to expect each day.

While you're at it, make sure you cover a basic outline of assesments for the badge. Students should know what will go toward their official assessment.
