# Gold Badge: Week Two

# Day One

## **First thing in the morning remind students to take the Week 2 Canvas Initial Assesment**

<br>

# Repository Pattern Review

### After they have finished their quiz do a brief review of Repository Pattern
### Points to note:
    * Encapsulation of Methods
    * Reusability
    * No use of Console class

<br>

### This would be a good time to ask for any hanging questions from the previous week. Otherwise, proceed to the Morning Challenge. Give until lunch to finish.

# Morning Challenge
```text
Komodo insurance wants a simple program that asks users their name and what
type of vehicle they have to be insured. Vehicles might include car, boat, 
motorcycle, or plane. When the user enters a vehicle name, the console will
respond with a fixed amount for insurance for one month.  For simplicity, we’ll 
handle three age ranges. Note: These figures are completely random.

Age          Car     Boat    Motorcycle      Plane
18-27        150     200     200             1000
27-65        50      100     100             500
65+          100     150     250             1000
```
