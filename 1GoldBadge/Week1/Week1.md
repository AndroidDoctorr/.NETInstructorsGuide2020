# Week One

## Welcome to Gold Badge!

### Gold Badge students need a lot of you time. Be sure to set up guidelines for how your Gold Badge class will run. This is **_essential_** to do early on. Good recomendations:

* Establish when you will be available on slack
* Outline the instructor/student responsibility for learning and how that will change from badge to badge. Be sure to revisit this concept at the beginning of Blue.
* Remind them that this will be a ***fast*** paced course. There will still be considerable responsibility on them to make sure they're on pace.
* Lay out a basic outline of what to expect each day
* Lay out a basic outline of assessments. Students should know what will go toward their official assessment
