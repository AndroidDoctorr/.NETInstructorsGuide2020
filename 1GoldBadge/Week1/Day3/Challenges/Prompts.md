Here we have six morning whiteboard challenges.

You do not need to have the students complete them all, but they are available if needed. Example answers provided in [here](./Answers.md).

1. Declare and initialize three variables. One of type `int`, one of type `string`, and one of type `DateTime`.  
2. Create a method that subtracts to numbers and returns the value.  
3. Create a method that takes two strings from the user and outputs a string.  
4. Write a switch case that asks the user if they are wearing clothes.  
5. Write a if else statement that uses a boolean to check if the user is happy.  
6. Write a if else if else that asks the user how much money they make a year. Check ranges between 1,000-10,000, 11,000-50,000, and 51,000-100,000. Output to the test runner based on each salary range. Have an else statement to prepare for the user not giving their salary range or out of the ranges we are checking.
