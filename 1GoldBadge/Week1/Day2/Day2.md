Day 2 is a pretty hefty day. You'll start with presentations and then you'll be introducing a lot of new C# fundamentals today. These are just introductions, we'll be revisiting these topics over and over as we go. Programming, like most things, is learned through repetition. Students should not freak out if they're not getting everything the first, second, or third time through.

You'll start the day off by having the students [present their CSS Creatures](CreaturePresentations.md). The time this will take will vary depending on the class size. Ideally, try to limit this to being completed no later than 10:00.

Once the presentations are done you'll need to start the C# lecture portion of the day.  
We have this broken into a handful of broad categories:

1. [Types and Variables](LectureMaterials/TypesAndVariables.md)
2. [Operators](LectureMaterials/Operators.md)
3. [Conditionals](LectureMaterials/Conditionals.md)
4. [Loops](LectureMaterials/Loops.md)
5. [Intro to Methods](LectureMaterials/IntroToMethods.md)

Lecture should take up a large portion of the day. When that's done you can start [wrapping up the day](WrapUp.md).
