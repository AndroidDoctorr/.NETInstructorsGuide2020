We'll start Day 3 off with a set of whiteboarding challenges. These will cover C# materials learned in the previous day as well as prework. The rest of the day will cover Method review, a very basic introduction to SOLID/APIE, Classes (including Properties and Constructors), the concept of Scope, reviewing collections, and indexing through a collection.

The whiteboarding challenges should take no more than an hour. Make sure the instructor and any assistants are walking around the room, guiding if necessary. Ideally you should be reviewing these by 10:00 at the latest.  
You can find the both the [prompts](Challenges/Prompts.md) and [example answers](Challenges/Answers.md) for the challenges here in the GitBook.

Once all students are done you'll need to start the C# lecture portion of the day.  
We have this broken into a handful of broad categories:

1. [Types and Variables](LectureMaterials/TypesAndVariables.md)  
2. [Operators](LectureMaterials/Operators.md)  
3. [Conditionals](LectureMaterials/Conditionals.md)  
4. [Loops](LectureMaterials/Loops.md)  
5. [Intro to Methods](LectureMaterials/IntroToMethods.md)

Lecture should take up a large portion of the day. When that's done you can start [wrapping up the day](WrapUp.md).
