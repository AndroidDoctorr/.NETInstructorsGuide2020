Today will be spent mostly reviewing/covering HTML and CSS as well as an overview of the course. Day one is a little slow, but don't worry the class definitely will speed up quickly.

Start off with [Introductions](Introduction.md). This can take up a lot of time, so try and limit it to be **done by 9:30**.

Depending on how much time this takes, you can utilize the optional [2 Truths, 1 Lie challenge](2Truths1Lie.md). This is good if you have to check a lot of installs or work on setup. Ideally this will take no more than **20-30 minutes**.

Your first lecture will be the [HTML Forms Lecture](FormLecture.md). As the first lecture, this will give you an opportunity to get the class interacting with you and their classmates. Don't expect much, and don't get frustrated if everyone is quiet. Make a point to ask questions and give them time, but don't lose too much time. There's a lot to do this day.  
After the lecture they'll need to take the **HTML Forms Quiz in Canvas**. This gives them a simple activity that may help them realize they need to pay more attention, or maybe just a helpful way to review/feel good. It would be good to have everything up to this point **done by 10:45** at the latest. This is to allow time for the other morning work.

For the remainder of the morning, give out the [Register Page Assignment](RegisterPageAssignment.md). Allow the students plenty of time to create their registration page. After lunch you can come back and deploy what the students have to GitHub Pages.  
**This will include a brief git introduction.**

Once done with the **Register Page Assignment**, roughly around **14:45**, give out the Smiley Face Module and [CSS Creature Assignment](CSSCreature.md). This will be a good amount of work for the remainder of the afternoon.
