# Introduction

## Welcome to the Dot Net Curriculum Guide!

### This GitBook is designed to be a simple easy guide to teaching the full Eleven Fifty Academy course for Dot Net. We have broken this out as follows: 
```text
Badge 
    Week
        Day of Week
        Bonus Challenges
```
Each Badge has a section for its subsequent weeks and days. There may be fluctuation in each cohort's needs but this should serve as a rough guide to follow.
