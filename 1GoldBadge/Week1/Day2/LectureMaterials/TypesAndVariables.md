For this lecture you'll be discussing Types and how to use them with Variables.

In C# we have two main categories for types:
* [Value](ValueTypes.md)
* [Reference](ReferenceTypes.md)

You'll also find people talking about [Primitive types](https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/variables-primitive-data-types). Primitives have some overlap with value types, but they're not 1:1. For example, strings are a primitive reference type.
